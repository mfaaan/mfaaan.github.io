    <div class="card prose" style="margin-top:18px;">
      <p>We attune to what is arising for you in each session and I offer what is most supportive that day. Sometimes it’s a dedicated coaching practice, sometimes it’s a deeper bodywork session, and sometimes it’s a blend of both.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Somatic coaching</h2>
      <div class="card prose">
        <p>We are embodied beings who experience the entirety of our lives through the unified field that is our soma. Emotions, thoughts, desires, values, and actions are all felt through and enacted from the body. The idea of a separate mind from body and spirit originated through colonization as a means of domination.</p>
        <p>In somatic coaching, we get curious about your particular shaping. How do you live inside your body? What holding patterns do you carry and where do they come from? How has your shape been impacted and formed by culture, lineage, and community? And perhaps most importantly, what do you long for and who do you want to become?</p>
        <p>Sessions are active and dynamic—we practice and begin to move into new shaping together. In practice, this often looks like slowing down, noticing what your body is doing in real time, and experimenting with new ways of being—together.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Somatic bodywork</h2>
      <div class="card prose">
        <p class="quote">“Through bodywork, we go directly to our tissues—and to the patterns they carry—to meet them, relieve them, and create the conditions for lasting change.” — Strozzi Institute for Somatics</p>
        <p>We are fundamentally wired as human beings to attune to and respond to touch from the moment of birth. I believe that there is healing that the body can only access through intentional touch.</p>
        <p>Somatic bodywork is a gentle, hands-on practice that works with and through the body to shift long held patterns, tensions, and ways of being through a combination of touch, breath, movement, and awareness.</p>
        <p><strong>Bodywork takes place fully clothed on a massage table</strong> and is always guided by your choice and consent.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Consultation</h2>
      <div class="card prose">
        <p>I offer consultation to other healing arts practitioners—therapists, coaches, bodyworkers, and more—in two capacities:</p>
        <p>1) From a somatics and expressive arts perspective for practitioners who want to further integrate those modalities into their practice, and<br>
           2) From a decolonial and social justice orientation for practitioners who want a deeper understanding of their clients or another perspective on their overall practice.</p>
