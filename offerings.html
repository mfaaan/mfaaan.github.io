    <p class="about-lede">
      Somatic coaching and bodywork are integrated in my practice.
      We attune to what is arising for you in each session and I offer what is most supportive that day.
      Sometimes it’s a dedicated coaching practice, sometimes it’s a deeper bodywork session,
      and sometimes it’s a blend of both.

      <h2>Somatic Coaching</h2>
      <p>
        We are embodied beings who experience the entirety of our lives through the unified field that is our soma.
        Emotions, thoughts, desires, values, and actions are all felt through and enacted from the body.
        The idea of a separate mind from body and spirit originated through colonization as a means of domination.
        Without integration within the embodied self, it becomes easier to disconnect from our felt sense of values
        such as love, compassion, and justice. Embodiment is who we are and it is an act of liberation to begin
        to reclaim a holistic sense of self beyond the mind/body binary.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:16px;">
        In somatic coaching, we get curious about your particular shaping. How do you live inside your body?
        What holding patterns do you carry and where do they come from? How has your shape been impacted and formed
        by culture, lineage, and community? And perhaps most importantly, what do you long for and who do you want to become?
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:16px;">
        Sessions are active and dynamic, we practice and begin to move into new shaping together.
        Through somatic coaching, you get to grow into an embodied way of being that feels more attuned, connected,
        resourced, aligned, and alive to you. In practice, this often looks like slowing down, noticing what your body
        is doing in real time, and experimenting with new ways of being — together.

      <h2>Somatic Bodywork</h2>

      <div class="about-callout">
        <p>
          “Through bodywork, we go directly to our tissues—and to the patterns they carry—to meet them, relieve them,
          and create the conditions for lasting change.”<br>
          <strong>— Strozzi Institute for Somatics</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        We are fundamentally wired as human beings to attune to and respond to touch from the moment of birth.
        I believe that there is healing that the body can only access through intentional touch. The body holds memory
        through neural pathways in our muscles, tissues, organs, and bones, even if we cannot recall it in our conscious memory.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:16px;">
        Somatic bodywork is a way to gain direct access to long held somatic patterns.
        It’s a gentle, hands-on practice that works with and through the body to shift these patterns, tensions,
        and ways of being through a combination of touch, breath, movement, and awareness.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:16px;">
        Bodywork takes place fully clothed on a massage table and is always guided by your choice and consent.

      <h2>Somatic Coaching for Parents Group</h2>
      <p>
        I am in the process of building a somatic coaching group for parents who are on the path of liberatory parenthood,
        who may not have had models of attuned and loving parents themselves and are committed to raising their own children
        differently. Please check back for more details soon or get on my email list to find out when it opens.

      <h2>Workshops</h2>
      <p>
        I run a few public workshops throughout the year, both through my own practice and in partnership with the
        Asian American Justice and Innovation Labs. Sign up for my mailing list to get notified of workshops.

      <h2>Consultation</h2>
      <p>
        I offer consultation to other healing arts practitioners — from therapists, coaches, bodyworkers, and more —
        in 2 capacities:
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:16px;">
        1) From a somatics and expressive arts perspective for practitioners who are wanting to further integrate
        those modalities into their practice, and
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:10px;">
        2) From a decolonial and social justice orientation for practitioners who are seeking a deeper understanding
        of their clients or another perspective on their overall practice.
