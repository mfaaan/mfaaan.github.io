      <p><strong>Sessions take place in my North Oakland office:</strong><br>
        6536 Telegraph Ave. Suite A101, Oakland, CA 94609</p>

      <p><strong>Rates for 1:1 work</strong><br>
        • 60 min – $165<br>
        • 90 min – $245</p>

      <p><strong>Sliding Scale:</strong> A number of sliding scale spots are reserved for low income BIPOC clients. Please reach out to request one.</p>

      <p><strong>Mutual Aid for Gaza:</strong> 10% of proceeds go toward mutual aid for families in Gaza. In addition, I occasionally offer sessions in exchange for a full-fee donation to specific families in Gaza. Sign up for my mailing list to be notified about these sessions.</p>

        <p><strong>What is your availability?</strong><br>
        I currently have openings on Thursdays. If those times don’t work for you, please email me to find another time—I have some limited availability on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays.</p>

        <p><strong>What is the commitment?</strong><br>
        First sessions are 90 minutes long. Subsequent sessions can be 60 or 90 minutes long depending on your preference and availability. I work with new clients weekly or biweekly for 3 months, as this is the frequency and length of time which creates space for change and moves the work forward. We check in after the first few sessions to see how the work is landing for you. In rare cases, I may see clients once a month for a longer session.</p>

        <p><strong>How do you accept payment?</strong><br>
        Payment is through Venmo (@Melissa-Fan), PayPal (melissa.anran.fan@gmail.com), or cash, and is due at the time of our session.</p>

        <p><strong>What are your COVID-19 safety protocols?</strong><br>
        There is a HEPA air purifier running in the room at all times and I open the windows in between sessions to air out the room as well. I always wear a KN95 mask when giving bodywork and am happy to wear one for the entirety of the session if you prefer. Masks are optional for clients. I can also bring in a 2nd HEPA air purifier upon request. The office waiting room is shared with other practitioners who have differing levels of precaution.</p>
