      <h2>Training &amp; Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I have a MA in Counseling Psychology with a concentration in Expressive Arts Therapy from CIIS and have
        additional training in somatic therapy, eco therapy, and hypnotherapy. I have worked as a trauma therapist
        for BIPOC youth in Oakland, a relationship coach for co-housing cooperatives, facilitated visioning retreats
        for grassroots orgs, and held a variety of educational and healing spaces in partnership with organizations
        such as the Asian American Justice and Innovation Lab, the Feminist Center for Creative Work, the Center for
        Political Education, and Bay Resistance. I am trained in somatic bodywork through the Strozzi Institute and
        receive direct mentorship from politicized somatics lineage teachers.

      <p>
        <strong>Somatic coaching and bodywork are my current offerings toward a more loving, open, and just world.</strong>
        After having trained in and offered many different modalities of healing over the years, I have found somatics
        to be the most effective path for creating lasting change.

      <h2>What Guides My Work</h2>
      <p>
        I ground my work in principles of social justice, decolonization, and abolition, understanding that we are
        simultaneously shaped by both the dominant structures of oppression and by cultures of resistance. Reverence
        for earth and spirit and a good dose of humility serve as pillars in my practice.

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Lineage, Lived Experience, &amp; Social Location</h2>
      <p>
        I know that lived experience, lineage, and social location shape our sense of attunement, reflection, and
        safety. I am a queer femme, a neurospicy survivor of trauma, a daughter of a Chinese immigrant single mom,
        and a mama to twins born in the early days of the pandemic. I am an artist at heart and am rediscovering
        song and dance as portals of joy. I love the public library, have a weakness for fine tea (thank you
        ancestors), and I believe children are our comrades.
