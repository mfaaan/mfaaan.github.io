    <p>Melissa Anran Fan is in the chrysalis. It’s all goo right now.</p>
    
    <h2>Most Recent (Pre-Goo) Bio:</h2>
    <p>Melissa Anran Fan (she/they) is a somatics practitioner, community organizer, writer, and cultural worker living in service of collective liberation. She holds an MA in Counseling Psychology with a concentration in expressive arts therapy and has additional training in somatic therapy, ecotherapy, and integrative change work. Her work is deeply influenced by Buddhism, abolition, revolutionary mothering, and the earth. On a lifelong path of decolonization and living in integrity, some of her current dreams involve imagining co-housing cooperatives, reconnecting with her Chinese ancestry, and building radical parenting communities. She lives in unceded Ohlone land in the East Bay of California and is a mama to twins.</p>

    <p>You can find her providing somatic grounding at the weekly PSA: Palestine Solidarity Announcements, running occasional workshops in the People’s School for Justice at AAJIL, writing on Substack, or being a fool on IG.
